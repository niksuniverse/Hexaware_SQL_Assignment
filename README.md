# 🚀 **Hexaware_SQL_Assignment**

> 📊 *A full-fledged SQL + OOP-based backend system to manage electronic gadget sales at TechShop.*

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The **TechShop Management System** is a comprehensive object-oriented and database-integrated application developed and designed to manage electronic gadget sales for a fictional company named *TechShop*. It features robust SQL operations, object-oriented principles, custom exception handling, and full-stack functionality for managing products, customers, orders, inventory, and more.

This project is structured and implemented in compliance with **Hexavarsity’s Enterprise Application Development** standards and includes:

✅ SQL database schema with all relevant entities, relationships, and constraints  
✅ Advanced queries using joins, aggregates, subqueries, grouping, filtering, and dynamic user inputs

---

## ✅ **Features Implemented**

---

### 🗃️ **Database Design (Task 1)**

- Created **TechShop** database with 5 tables: `Customers`, `Products`, `Orders`, `OrderDetails`, `Inventory`
- Defined **primary and foreign key constraints**
- Inserted **10+ sample records** into each table
- Designed and included **ER Diagram** (located in `/resources`)

---

### 📘 **Task 2: Basic SQL Operations**

- Implemented `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` for customer, order, and product management  
- Enabled **user-driven queries** for adding customers, updating prices, recalculating totals, and deleting specific records based on input parameters

---

### 📊 **Task 3: Joins, Aggregations & Reporting**

- Used `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and **aggregate functions** to generate reports like top products, revenue by customer, and most ordered items  
- Developed queries for **listing customer orders**, **average order value**, **product popularity**, and **sales within a date range**

---

### 🧠 **Task 4: Subqueries for Business Insights**

- Applied **single-row, multi-row, and correlated subqueries** to find inactive customers, total revenue, and top spenders  
- Created dynamic queries for **category-wise averages**, **customer-specific totals**, and **product/category analytics**
